  <h1>Tributes to Rent A Pet</h1>

  <h2>Bessie Anderson</h2>

    <p>
    I live in a retirement community that prohibits pets. Rent A Pet allowed me to enjoy the companionship of a lovable basset hound named Sophie.
    </p>

    <p>
    We take long walks in the park every Saturday. Rent A Pet delivers and picks her up, and I never worry about feeding or care.

    <p>
    Thank you for giving me something to look forward to each week.

    <h2>Jason Hutchingson</h2>

    <p>
    I live in an apartment and always wanted a large dog to run and play with. Rent A Pet matched me with a German Shepherd named Kamikaze.
    </p>

    <p>
    We run, ski, and play Frisbee together. Thanks to Rent A Pet, I even met my fiancée while playing in the park.
    </p>

    <p>
    Until I can own my own dog, Rent A Pet gives me the companionship I need.

    <h2>Michael Pinette</h2>

    <p>
    My job requires frequent travel, so owning a pet would be difficult. Rent A Pet lets me enjoy exotic animals without responsibility.
    </p>

    <p>
    I have rented a snake, a Saint Bernard, a pot-bellied pig, and an iguana. It adds excitement to my life without worry.

   <h2>Melinda Morrison</h2>

   <p>
    I grew up loving horses but never had the chance to own one. Rent A Pet made my dream possible.
   </p>

    <p>
    They deliver the horse to the trail I choose, and I can request the same horse
    each time. Rent A Pet made a lifelong dream come true.
