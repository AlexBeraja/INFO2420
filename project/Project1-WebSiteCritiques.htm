        <h2>Sablétine Fine Pastries - <a href="https://sabletine.com/index.html">https://sabletine.com/index.html</a></h2>
        <p><strong>1.</strong> My first impression is that the site feels welcoming and straightforward, with clear store information and a simple path to order online.
        </p>

        <p><strong>2.</strong> The site organizes information primarily from top to center: key notices and a short description appear on the main page, and ordering is 
            routed to their online store via a prominent "Shop Sablétine Online!" button, so the flow goes from overview to shopping.</p>

        <p><strong>3.</strong> The structure makes sense because the homepage focuses on essential details (hours/ordering) and then hands off shopping to the online
        store, this keeps the main site uncluttered.</p>

        <p><strong>4.</strong> The graphics are minimal and the layout is plain, which keeps attention on the content. The lack of heavy multimedia helps carity rather than
        distracting from it</p>

        <p><strong>5.</strong> The home page loaded quickly, within a couple of seconds, which is reasonable for a site with minimal multimedia that is mostly text based</p>

        <p><strong>6.</strong> The text color and size are readable on a light background, and the minimal styling helps legibility.</p>

        <p><strong>7.</strong> The site provides clear navigation to its online ordering through a visible link/button, and the store itself uses standard product
        listings and categories that are easy to follow.</p>

        <p><strong>8.</strong> The overall look and feel is consistent: simple layout and straightforward links on the main site, and a uniform product grid and typography 
        style within the online store pages.</p>

        <p><strong>9.</strong> When the window is smaller, the simple content remains readable and the online store pages reflow into a single-column layout, 
        which works fine on mobile.</p>

        <p><strong>10.</strong> The smooth handoff from the main site to the online store is well done, and the store's product pages make it easy to find items like croissants, 
        breads, and pastries quickly.</p>
