    <h2 id="beginning">In the beginning</h2>

    <p>
        Rent A Pet began with a family that loved dogs. George Smith and his wife Carol owned two Irish Setters. 
        These dogs were pets to the Smith family children and extended family members.
    </p>
    <p>
        One day as George was walking his dogs in the park, he noticed how they attracted the attention of passing women. 
        A young woman remarked that she would love to havea big dog like that to walk, but she had a small apartment and couldn't keep a large dog.
    </p>
    <p>
        This brief encounter was the beginning of an idea. What if there were others who wanted the companionship of pets without the responsibility?
    </p>

    <p>
    After weighing the advantages and disadvantages, the Smiths decided to move forward. In the fall of 1980, Rent A Pet officially opened.

    The business began by renting dogs only. Since then, Rent A Pet has expanded to include cats, horses, pigs, and snakes.

    Rent A Pet expanded from its original Provo location and now operates franchises in Logan, Bountiful, Salt Lake City, and St. George.
